## Base


### Description
This assignment was my first time using onshape and I was really just feeling around and starting to get aclimated to the new CAD program. I learned how to extrude and make linear patterns, both of which are a litle bit different on onshape.

## Mount

### Description
This part is very similar to the base so I finished it very quickly.

## Fork

### Description
This assignment took me a bit longer because I got my mirror wrong the first time and I hadn't realized it was wrong until I tried bringing into my final assembly.

## Tire

### Description 
This part was pretty easy, but I learned how to use the revolve tool on onshape which is pretty cool.

## Wheel 

### Description
This definitely took me the longest out of all of the parts because I made the same mistake I made last year, my rectangles were not symetric which gave me problems when I was revolving it.
