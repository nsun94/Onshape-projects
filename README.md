## Base


### Description
This assignment was my first time using onshape and I was really just feeling around and starting to get aclimated to the new CAD program. I learned how to extrude and make linear patterns, both of which are a litle bit different on onshape.

## Mount

### Description
This part is very similar to the base so I finished it very quickly.

## Fork

### Description
This assignment took me a bit longer because I got my mirror wrong the first time and I hadn't realized it was wrong until I tried bringing into my final assembly.

## Tire

### Description 
This part was pretty easy, but I learned how to use the revolve tool on onshape which is pretty cool.

## Wheel 

### Description
This definitely took me the longest out of all of the parts because I made the same mistake I made last year, my rectangles were not symetric which gave me problems when I was revolving it.

## Axle, Collar, Bearings

### Description
These pieces were very easy to make.

## Sub-Assembly

### Description

This was my first time making an assembly in onshape and it was not very difficult. The mates were a bit tricky but once I got used to them they were no problem.

## Final-Assembly

### Description

This assembly was not hard because in the previous assignment I learned how to do mates, it was cool to see everything come together though.
